# Squid_Game

# Project Description
The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on social media posts related to "Squid Game." By analyzing the sentiment of these posts, we can determine the overall public opinion and identify the major themes in the discussions about the series.

# Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure the quality of the analysis. The preprocessing steps include:
Cleaning: Removing URLs, special characters, and numbers.
Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
Stop Words Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute to the sentiment (e.g., "the", "is", "in").
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form (e.g., "running" to "run").

# Sentiment Analysis
We utilized the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool to analyze the preprocessed text. VADER is specifically designed for social media text and provides sentiment scores that classify the text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. These scores were then compiled into an Excel file for further analysis.

# Results
The sentiment analysis revealed the following:

Positive Sentiment: Posts expressing positive opinions about "Squid Game."
Negative Sentiment: Posts expressing negative opinions about "Squid Game."
Neutral Sentiment: Posts expressing neutral opinions about "Squid Game."
The overall sentiment distribution showed a predominance of neutral sentiments, indicating that most social media discussions were neither overtly positive nor negative.
